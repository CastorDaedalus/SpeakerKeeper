# SpeakerKeeper

SpeakerKeeper is a simple utility that prevents your computer's speaker from going to sleep after a period of inactivity.
It works by playing a nearly silent audio file at specified intervals, which keeps the speaker active.

## How it works

After launching the app, the user can select the audio output device and the time interval for playing the audio file.
The app runs silently in the background and automatically places an icon in the system tray while running. 

From the menu, you can reset the configuration or stop playing the audio file.
The app is customizable, and the sound file "sound.mp3" can be replaced by any MP3 file you want.
